# Tech Skills Taxonomy Explorer: A Methodological Guide

This document provides an in-depth overview of the Tech Skills Taxonomy Explorer. It is intended for those interested in details on the methodologies, calculations, and algorithms underpinning the system. The tool leverages data processing pipelines, high-dimensional embedding techniques, GPU-accelerated computations, and statistical analyses to map and interpret technology skills data.

## 1\. Overview

The Skills Taxonomy visualization maps technology skills as points in a two-dimensional latent space, where proximity reflects semantic similarity. Clusters are derived from a combination of embedding reduction and density-based clustering, and each cluster is annotated with extensive salary, temporal, and distribution metrics.

## 2\. Interface and Interaction

### 2\.1. DataMapPlot — Visualization Canvas

- **Data Points:**\
   Each point corresponds to a unique skill/technology entity. The underlying data points are produced from high-dimensional embeddings generated by transformer models.

- **Clusters:**\
   Clusters are formed by grouping points that are close in the reduced latent space. The clustering is based on density via GPU-accelerated HDBSCAN.

- **Color Encoding:**\
   Points are colored using pre-defined palettes that map categorical variables (e.g., taxonomy labels) to hex color codes. Multiple color schemes are available (e.g., based on posting month, salary range, job specialization, etc.).

- **Point Scaling:**\
   The marker size of each point is determined by a log-transformed salary metric. Specifically, the transformation involves:

   - Applying the logarithm (log1p) to annualized salary data to reduce skew.

   - Scaling linearly to a defined range (e.g., 1 to 50 pixels), with clipping to ensure minimum and maximum visual thresholds.

### 2\.2. Interactive Features

- **Zoom and Pan:**\
   Standard mouse wheel or pinch-to-zoom gestures and click-and-drag actions allow navigation across the visualization canvas. The underlying rendering uses WebGL for real-time performance.

- **Selection:**

   - **Left-Click:** Selects individual points.

   - **Right-Click:** Automatically selects all points within the same cluster (based on matching categorical attributes such as cluster ID, subcategory, and name).

   - **Lasso Tool:** Enables polygonal selection for extracting arbitrary subsets.

- **Search Functionality:**\
   A full-text search box indexes the skill names and metadata, allowing users to quickly filter by specific keywords or taxonomy terms.

## 3\. Data Understanding and Metrics

### 3\.1. Hover Information (Tooltips)

#### Salary Metrics

- **Estimated Salary Range:**\
   Displays the minimum, median, and maximum salary values for the cluster. Salaries are normalized to an annual basis.

- **Cluster Salary Statistics:**

   - **Median and Mean:** Computed on the non-outlier salary subset. Outliers are detected using the Modified Z-score method: \
       $MZ_i = 0.6745 \times \frac{x_i - \text{median}(X)}{\text{MAD}(X)}$  where $\text{MAD}(X)$is the median absolute deviation. Values with $|MZ_i| > 3.5$ are excluded.

   - **Salary Rank:** Clusters are ranked based on their median salary. For example, "Rank 5 of 150" indicates the cluster's ordinal position among all clusters.

   - **Salary Percentile:**  $\text{Percentile} = \left(\frac{\text{Total Clusters} - \text{Rank} + 1}{\text{Total Clusters}}\right) \times 100$

#### Temporal Metrics

- **Growth Rate:**\
   A normalized measure (ranging from -1.0 to 1.0) calculated using a 90-day sliding window: \
   $\text{Growth Rate} = \frac{C_{\text{end}} - C_{\text{start}}}{C_{\text{start}}}$\
    where $C_{\text{start}}$ and $C_{\text{end}}$ denote the counts at the beginning and end of the window, respectively.

- **Temporal Pattern:**\
   Categorical assignment based on time series characteristics:

   - **New:** Minimal historical data.

   - **Trending:** Statistically significant positive growth.

   - **Concentrated:** High-frequency occurrences in discrete periods.

   - **Seasonal:** Recurring patterns identified via monthly aggregation.

   - **Stable:** Consistent counts over time.

- **Age Metrics (in Quarters):**

   - **Average Age:** Mean time since the skill’s first occurrence (days converted to quarters by dividing by 90).

   - **Median Age:** Robust central measure of the distribution.

   - **Newest Entry:** Minimum age value, indicating the most recent occurrence.

#### Volume and Distribution Metrics

- **Sample Size:**\
   The total number of job postings or mentions for a given skill cluster.

- **Size Classification:**\
   Determined by thresholds:

   - **Small:** $< 50$ mentions.

   - **Medium:** $50 \leq$ mentions $\leq 200$.

   - **Large:** $> 200$ mentions.

- **Monthly Distribution:**\
   Data is aggregated by year and month to form a frequency distribution, facilitating the analysis of seasonal trends.

## 4\. Color Schemes and Visual Encodings

Multiple color layers are passed as a dictionary to DMP to visualize different dimensions:

- **Posting Month:** Colors are assigned based on the month of data posting.

- **Salary Range:** A gradient mapping from low to high salaries.

- **Job Specialization:** Distinct colors for various specialized roles.

- **Salary Distribution:** Log-scaled color mapping to emphasize relative differences.

- **Age Metrics:** Separate views for individual skill age, cluster average age, and the newest entry.

- **Overlays:** Additional metrics such as anomaly scores (using entropy and concentration measures) and salary rank percentiles are also encoded.

## 5\. Methodological Details

### 5\.1. Dimensionality Reduction

- **Embedding Generation:**\
   Textual data (e.g., skill names, job titles) are converted into high-dimensional vectors using transformer models (e.g., `SentenceTransformer` with the *all-mpnet-base-v2* model). These embeddings capture semantic nuances of the text.

- **UMAP _(GPU-accelerated)_:**\
   The Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) algorithm reduces the high-dimensional embeddings to two dimensions. Key parameters include:

   - **`n_neighbors`:** Typically 40, balancing local and global structure.

   - **`min_dist`:** Set to 0.05 to control the tightness of clusters.

   - **`Metric`:** Cosine distance, ideal for text similarity.

### 5\.2. Clustering Algorithms

- **HDBSCAN _(GPU-accelerated)_:**\
   A density-based clustering algorithm that does not require a pre-specified number of clusters. Parameters such as `min_cluster_size` (e.g., 100) and `min_samples` (e.g., 20) are tuned to filter noise.

### 5\.3. Salary Analysis

- **Normalization:**\
   Raw salary data is annualized and then transformed using a logarithmic function $(\log(1+x))$ to mitigate skewness. A linear rescaling maps the log-transformed values to a predefined visual marker range.

- **Outlier Detection:**\
   The Modified Z-score method (threshold of 3.5) is used to remove outliers prior to computing median and mean statistics. Additionally, a trimmed mean (10% trim using SciPy's `trim_mean`) is computed for robustness.

- **Statistical Measures:**\
   Skewness and kurtosis are computed to assess the distributional characteristics of salary data.

### 5\.4. Temporal Metrics Computation

- **Windowing and Aggregation:**\
   The analysis considers a 90-day period ending at the last complete month. Temporal counts are aggregated by grouping timestamps by year and month.

- **Age Calculations:**\
   For each cluster, ages are calculated as the difference (in days) between the current maximum date and the date of each entry, then converted to quarters (dividing by 90). Mean, median, and minimum (newest) values are then computed.

- **Projection and Growth Rate:**\
   For partial months, a projection is computed by scaling the current month’s count to an estimated full-month value based on elapsed days.

### 5\.5. Taxonomy Integration and Data Filtering

- **Data Ingestion:**\
   Taxonomy data is loaded from SQL databases or cached parquet files using `cuDF` for efficient GPU processing.

- **Frequency Thresholding:**\
   Skills are filtered based on occurrence frequency (e.g., a minimum of 50 mentions) to remove noise and overly generic entries.

- **Imputation:**\
   Missing salary values are replaced with cluster medians to maintain consistency in statistical computations.

### 6\.2. Selection Handlers

Custom JavaScript selection handlers integrated with the `DataMapPlot` framework manage both click and lasso-based selections:

   Toggle selection status and update the view in real-time.
