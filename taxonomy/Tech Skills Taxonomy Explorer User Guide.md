## Analyzing the Data

### Cluster Analysis

Clusters are formed based on several factors:

- **Semantic Similarity:** Grouping skills that are conceptually related.

- **Co-occurrence in Job Postings:** Skills that frequently appear together.

- **Related Technology Stacks:** Similar technical ecosystems.

- **Similar Salary Ranges:** Clustering by compensation metrics.

### Temporal Analysis

The visualization helps you identify:

- **Emerging Technologies:** Skills that are rapidly gaining traction.

- **Declining Skills:** Technologies that are losing prominence.

- **Seasonal Patterns:** Variations in demand over different months.

- **Industry Shifts:** Broad trends in technology adoption and job market evolution.

### Salary Analysis

Salary data is normalized and analyzed to reveal:

- **Market Value of Skills:** Understand compensation trends across clusters.

- **Salary Trends Within Clusters:** Compare median and mean salaries.

- **Compensation Patterns:** Insights across different job specializations.

- **Regional Variations:** Where available, highlighting geographic differences in salary.

## Tips for Effective Use

### Exploration

- **Start with the Default View:** Begin by exploring the default category to gain an overall understanding.

- **Switch Color Schemes:** Experiment with different color schemes to focus on specific aspects, such as posting month or salary distribution.

- **Zoom and Pan:** Use zoom and pan features to navigate dense clusters and investigate individual points.

- **Search:** Use the search functionality to quickly locate specific skills or technologies.

### Analysis

- **Compare Related Clusters:** Look for similarities and differences in salary and temporal metrics.

- **Examine Temporal Patterns:** Identify emerging trends or seasonal fluctuations.

- **Review Salary Distributions:** Benchmark market values and compare across clusters.

- **Consider Skill Relationships:** Analyze how different skills relate to one another based on their cluster grouping.

### Selection

- **Multi-Select Options:** Use multi-select (via lasso tool or right-click) for comparing groups of skills.

- **Right-Click for Cluster Selection:** Quickly select all points in a cluster for a comprehensive analysis.

- **Custom Selections:** Tailor your analysis by creating custom selections to focus on subsets of data.

---

## Data Quality Notes

- **Outlier Detection:** Outliers are automatically detected and filtered to ensure reliable metrics.

- **Missing Data Imputation:** Missing salary values are imputed using cluster medians.

- **Growth Rate Calculation:** Growth rates are calculated using a 90-day window.

- **Temporal Pattern Reliability:** Temporal metrics require a minimum sample size for accuracy.

---

## Additional Features

### Search and Filtering

- **Full-Text Search:** Quickly search across all skills.

## High-Level Methodology

### Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering

The tool uses advanced techniques to reduce high-dimensional data (such as skill descriptions and job titles) into a two-dimensional map while preserving relationships between data points. Similar skills are positioned closer together, and clustering algorithms then group these points based on semantic similarity, co-occurrence in job postings, technology stack relationships, and similar salary ranges.

### Salary and Temporal Analysis

- **Salary Metrics:** The system computes median and mean salary values for each cluster, using outlier detection to filter anomalous data.

- **Temporal Metrics:** Growth rates, age metrics (average, median, newest entry), and monthly distributions are calculated to highlight trends and seasonal variations.

### Taxonomy Data Integration

Data is loaded from a curated taxonomy where infrequent or overly generic skills are filtered out based on preset frequency thresholds. This ensures that the visualization focuses on high-quality, relevant data.

## Interactive Features

### Hover Tooltips

Hovering over a point reveals a tooltip that displays:

- **Salary Information:** Including salary ranges, median/mean salary, salary rank, and percentile.

- **Temporal Metrics:** Such as growth rate, temporal pattern, and age metrics.

- **Volume Metrics:** Like sample size and monthly distribution.

### Selection and Filtering

Interactive selection tools allow you to:

- **Click or Lasso-Select:** Pick individual or groups of points.

- **Right-Click:** Select an entire cluster.

- **Dynamic Filtering:** Refine your selection to focus on subsets of data.

### Search Functionality

A built-in search feature makes it easy to locate specific skills or clusters, streamlining the exploration process.
